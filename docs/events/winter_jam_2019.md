It's time for MMD's second WinterJam! This years flavour is frosty flakes :D This is a mod making event that is set to take place in December from the 1st till the 31st. Participants in this event are encouraged to create mods that fit a winter, festive, or new years theme. Festive can apply to any tradition, event, or religious ceremony that takes place during this time of year.

Unlike similar events, Winter Jam is a non competitive event. The focus of this event is learning new things, challenging yourself, and encouraging the creation of new content. At the end of the event, we will release a modpack to showcase the submissions. This pack will also be put on a public server, where people can play with the mods and experience them together for a limited time.

Participants and those following the event should use the [**#WinterJamMC**](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23winterjammc&src=typd) hashtag on twitter to talk about this event, or use the ``winterjam`` channel in our Discord server. We will also be using this hashtag to share update, and to help us find things to retweet.

## Guidelines
The following list of guidelines is in place to provide a fair experience for everyone. Not following these guidelines may result in your project being excluded from various rewards and/or promotions.

1. Submissions should make use of the seasonal theme of the event.
2. Teams are allowed. We recommend keeping to four members.
3. All assets and code should be created during the event.
4. Submissions should run on a dedicated server. Please be sure to test on a dedicated server not a Lan server.
5. Submissions should work with Minecraft 1.14.4 and be compatible with the latest release of Forge and MCP.
6. You may use any library or dependency you want, but you are responsible for issues caused by those dependencies.
7. You may submit multiple entries, or participate on multiple teams.
8. Mod generators such as MCreator are not allowed. Tools which generate pieces of code, such as IDE tools or some modeling programs are fine.
9. Submissions should be visible source.

Please note that the time zones for this event are somewhat loose. The event officially starts when the first time zone enters December 1st, and will officially end when the last time zone enters the 31st.

## Submissions
Submissions can be made by leaving a comment on [this gist](https://gist.github.com/ProxyNeko/37a15f1a918e73df302df523af9e68c6) page with the requested info. Submissions must be made before the 20th of December to give us an idea of how many submissions there will be, you can always add more content while the event is still running and we will update the pack as new features are released. If you fix a bug after you have made your submission, don't worry, you can update/edit your submission with the fixed version we should use, but please ensure it's on curse before you do. Once your submission has been reviewed, we will update the list of submissions to include your entry. 

Please check out #winterjam for further announcements and discussion!  

## Modpack/Server
After the submissions page has been opened we will put together a modpack containing all the submissions that follow our guidelines. This modpack will be hosted on our event server where everyone is welcome to join and test out the new mods. In addition the modpack will also include previous submissions that have been updated to be compatible with our server. The inclusion of previous year submissions will be done on a request basis so if you author one or have one you want included make sure to request it's inclusion by contacting a staff member. (Preferably ProxyNeko or Darkhax)  

## Rewards
Due to CurseForge removing our abilitie to transfer points we can sadly no longer offer a paid reward, however participants who make a valid submission will receive a WinterJam2019 role on Discord. This role is purely visual and meant to commemorate the event. Sort of like a badge of honour.
