## Can't code? Not a problem!
Hacktoberfest is open to all sorts of contributions, including translations, artwork, and documentation. While translating a mod to other languages may seem difficult it is actually very simple. Minecraft supports many variations of english and joke languages that virtually anyone can translate to.

### Common Languages
These languages are commonly spoken dialects of english. These translations may contain relevant slang and accents.
