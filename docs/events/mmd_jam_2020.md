To celebrate the fourth anniversary of MMD and our awesome community we are hosting our first official MMD Jam! The MMD Jam is a mod making competition where community members create new Minecraft mods and submit them to one or more of our submission categories. 

## Rules
The following rules are in place to provide a fair experience for everyone. Choosing not to follow them may result in your project being excluded from certain parts of the event.

1. Submissions should be created between the 2nd of May and the 16th of May.
2. Teams are allowed but there is a limit of 5 people per team.
3. Submissions must fit into at least one of the submission categories.
4. All assets and code should be created during the event. Open source code, libraries, and assets are also allowed.
5. Submissions must run on both the client and server without crashing.
6. Submissions must run on Minecraft 1.15.2 with the latest versions for Forge and MCP.

This event follows the [UTC time](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/timezone/utc) zone. The event starts when the UTC time zone enters May 2nd and runs until the end of May 16th. 

## Submissions
Submissions can be made by commenting on [this]() page with the required info. All submissions must fit into at least one submission category. Submissions must be commented before the end of the event to ensure they are included. 

The submission categories for this event are **Exploration, Technology, Magic, and General**.

## Servers and Modpacks
After the submission period has ended we will put together a modpack and a public server which showcase all qualifying mods. The server will be open to the public and will be live for the remainder of the month. 

## Judging
After the submission period has ended we will open up a voting channel on our Discord server. There will be a message in this channel for every submission. Members of the discord can vote for projects they like by reacting with an üëç emoji. Members can vote for as many projects as they want, and participants can also vote for their own projects. After one week of voting, we will close the voting and calculate the final scores for each mod.
