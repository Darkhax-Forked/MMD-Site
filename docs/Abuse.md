# Reporting Abuse
If you encounter anything which would warrant urgent legal attention from Discord, such as underage explicit material, please send a report to Discord by emailing `abuse@discordapp.com`. This email should **only** be used for legal issues, anything else should be sent to `support@discordapp.com`. 

When sending a report regarding content on Discord, you should try to include as much information as possible. The following is a list of information which is. 
- The discord tag of the user. This is the username followed by a # and ID number.
- The ID of the user.
- The name and ID of the server it happened on, if applicable.
- The ID of any relevant messages.

To get IDs, go to User Settings > Appearance > enable Dev Tools. This will add a`copy ID option to certain menus in Discord. To get a user's ID right click on their name in chat and click copy ID. Alternatively you can also right click on the user in a server's member list, or in your direct message list. To get the server ID, right click on the server and click copy ID. To get a message ID, right click while hovering over the message and click copy ID. Once an ID has been copied, it will be on your clipboard. 

# Protecting yourself from DM attacks
One type of attack seen on Discord is a DM attack. This is when a user or bot joins a server and sends direct messages to everyone on it. This attack is effective, as Discord will allow users who share a server with you to send DMs to you by default. Because of this, larger public servers are of higher risk. To change that setting right click on the server icon > Privacy Settings > Allow direct messages from server members. Once this is disabled, users from that server will not be able to send you a direct message unless they are on your friend list.
